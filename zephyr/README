KConfig symbols have been defined for adaptations made during porting to Zephyr.
A special symbol LUA_UNIMPLEMENTED is depended on by those features not yet supported.

Lua-native config (i.e., to override luaconf.h) is added as needed with proxy symbols via zephyr/compat/conf.h.

Override lua_compat_writestring (weak linkage) to implement I/O for lauxlib helpers. Use *ud to store per-interpreter I/O state.
